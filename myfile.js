// FILE TESTING

// Create a program that defines three variables of different types:
//
// 1. A string variable called "name" that stores your name.
// 2. An integer variable called "age" that stores your age.
// 3. A float variable called "height" that stores your height in meters.
//
// After defining the variables, print them out in the following format:
//
// "My name is [name], I am [age] years old and my height is [height] meters."
//
// Make sure to replace [name], [age], and [height] with the respective variable names.
