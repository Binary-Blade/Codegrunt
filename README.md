# CodeGrunt - File Generation Exercise with OpenAI

This project allows you to generate code files based on a programming language selected by the user. It uses the OpenAI API to generate content, such as simple exercises, and saves this content in a file depending on the chosen language.

## Features

- The user can choose a language from JavaScript, PHP, or Python.
- The program generates a file for the selected language. It includes an OpenAI-generated exercise on creating variables in programming for JavaScript.
- Uses `match` for handling different programming languages.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.10 or higher (for the `match` syntax)
- A valid OpenAI API key to access the API
- The required Python dependencies installed:

Here is the `README.md` file in **English** to introduce your project:

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Follow the prompts to select a programming language:
   - 1 for PHP
   - 2 for JavaScript
   - 3 for Python

3. If JavaScript is selected, a file `myfile.js` will be created with an exercise on creating variables in programming.
